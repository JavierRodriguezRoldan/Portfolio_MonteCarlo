Creation of a portfolio based in US stocks chosen acording to Sharpe ratio and parity wheights. 500 Monte Carlo Simulation to evaluate its performance.
This was part of a Risk Analysis course in my Buiness Intelligence masters program, it is not supposed to be the best possible strategy adn the specific stocks were given, the analysis is mine.
Thank you for your time.
